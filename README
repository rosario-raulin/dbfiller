This script simply adds users to a database table "users" by reading the email
address, last and first name from a file called "entries.txt".

entries.txt has the form:

[...]
email 1
last name 1
first name 1
email 2
lastname 2
first name 2
[...]

See index.php for an example.

Use config.php to add all the information needed to connect to the database.
